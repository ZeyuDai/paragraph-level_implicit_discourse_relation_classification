Doskocil Cos. said its bank-debt payments have been extended until May 31, 1990, to give it more time to sell its Wilson Foods Corp. retail and fresh meat operations. 

The company was to repay $58 million in debt on Dec. 31 and $15 million on March 31.
The company acquired the debt when it paid $155 million to purchase Wilson last year. 

An agreement to sell the Wilson assets for $150 million in cash and notes collapsed in late September, when the buyer, a company controlled by George Gillett, couldn't secure financing.
