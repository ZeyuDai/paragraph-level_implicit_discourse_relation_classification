Base Data 
Computers that once were the state of the art, 
The marvels bought three years ago, 
Are now obsolete.
As we queasily start
The search for replacements, we know 

The new one we purchase in hopes it will do, 
Despite every wonder that's stated, 
Means more speed, more graphics, more memory, too, 
But also more quickly out-dated! 
-- Bern Sharfman. 

Curdling Confession 
I know when dividends are due; 
When bonds should be retired; 
But what gets by me every time 
Is has the milk expired? 
-- Ralph Shaffer. 

Daffynition Tithing: Obedience to one-tenth Commandment.
