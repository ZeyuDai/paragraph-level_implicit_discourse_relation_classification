Nikon Corp. said unconsolidated pretax profit increased 70% to 12.12 billion yen ($85.3 million) in the first half ended Sept. 30, from 7.12 billion yen a year ago. 

The Tokyo camera maker said net income more than doubled to 5.85 billion yen, or 16.08 a share, from 2.63 billion yen, or 7.24 yen a share. 

Nikon said sales rose despite the adverse effect of Japan's unpopular consumption tax, introduced in April.
Increasing personal spending and capital investment are fueling growth, the company said.
Rising export sales also contributed to strong growth, Nikon added. 

Total sales gained 20% to 122.36 billion yen from 102.01 billion yen.
Exports made up 46.2% of the latest year's total, up from 39.8% a year ago. 

Camera sales showed the strongest gains, rising 37% to 50.59 billion yen. 

Nikon forecast sales for the year ending March 31 will rise 9.6% to 240 billion yen.
Pretax profit is expected to increase 18% to 22 billion yen and net income is expected to rise 53% to 10.5 billion yen.
