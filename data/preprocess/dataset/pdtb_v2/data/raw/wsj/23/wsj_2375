Moody's Investors Service said it reduced its rating on $165 million of subordinated debt of this Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift, citing turmoil in the market for low-grade, high-yield securities.
The agency said it reduced its rating on the thrift's subordinated debt to B-2 from Ba-2 and will keep the debt under review for possible further downgrade.
Columbia Savings is a major holder of so-called junk bonds.
New federal legislation requires that all thrifts divest themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years.
Columbia Savings officials weren't available for comment on the downgrade. 

FRANKLIN SAVINGS ASSOCIATION (Ottawa, Kan.) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded its rating to B-2 from Ba-3 on less than $20 million of this thrift's senior subordinated notes.
The rating concern said Franklin's "troubled diversification record in the securities business" was one reason for the downgrade, citing the troubles at its L.F. Rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries. "They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these," said Franklin President Duane H. Hall. "I think it was a little premature on their part."
