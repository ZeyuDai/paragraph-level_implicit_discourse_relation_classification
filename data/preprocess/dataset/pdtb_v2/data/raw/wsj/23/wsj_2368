The only thing Robert Goldberg could praise about CBS's new show "Island Son" (Leisure & Arts, Sept. 25) was the local color; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework.
For instance: "Haole" (white) is not the ultimate insult; "Mainland haole" is.
Richard Chamberlain dresses as a "Mainland haole," tucking in a Hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves.
And the local expression for brother is "brah," not "bruddah." And even if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while on duty, if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left, not right, ear.
Sorry, the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color.
