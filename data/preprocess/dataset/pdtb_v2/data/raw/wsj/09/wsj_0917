Burmah Oil PLC, a British independent oil company, said its West German subsidiary Castrol has a 49% share in Explonaft G.m.b.H., a new Polish lubricants company. 

The remaining 51% of the joint venture will be controlled by Polish lubricants manufacturers, refiners and technical institutes.
Explonaft will develop application guidelines for lubricants, sell high-quality mineral oils, and offer services in industrial cleaning and related fields. 

Burmah, which has a strong market position supplying marine lubricants and metal-working fluids in Poland, described the joint venture as "fairly small." It didn't provide details of setup costs.
