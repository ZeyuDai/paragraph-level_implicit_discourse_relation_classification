American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes will enable it to save $450 million in the next year.
AT&T also said net income rose 19% in the third quarter. 

AT&T said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments.
AT&T said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans, it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program. 

AT&T said third-quarter net income grew, despite stiff competition in all of the company's markets.
Net income rose to $699 million, or 65 cents a share, from the year-earlier $587 million, or 55 cents a share.
Revenue edged up to $8.9 billion from $8.81 billion. 

The latest period's net was reduced $102 million, or nine cents a share, for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment. 

The results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts, who were encouraged by AT&T increasing its operating margin to 13% from 11% a year ago, because of continued cost-cutting efforts.
Sales of long-distance services, an extremely competitive market, rose 6.4%.
But the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products. 

Under the amended pension program, AT&T managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes.
Managers who retire Dec. 30 will have an additional 15% added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65, whichever comes earlier. 

An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees.
Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package, which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months. "This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth," said Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. 

But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move won't result in even greater earnings growth. "This is a good move, but it only gets you to where people's expectations already are," in terms of earnings growth, said Joel D. Gross, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20% annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts it expects in the future. 

AT&T said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses.
But the company said the amount can't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire.
AT&T said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in Ing.C. Olivetti & Co. for shares in Cie.
Industriali Riunite, an Italian holding company. 

For the nine months, AT&T said net income was $1.99 billion, or $1.85 a share, up 19% from $1.67 billion, or $1.56 a share.
Revenue gained 3.1% to $26.81 billion from $26 billion. 

In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, AT&T shares closed at $43.375, up 87.5 cents.
