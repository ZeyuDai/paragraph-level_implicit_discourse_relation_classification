Chicago businessmen Bertram M. Lee and Peter Bynoe signed a new agreement to purchase the Denver Nuggets basketball team, but not as principal owners. 

On Saturday, the partners said the team would be purchased for $54 million by a new group including Comsat Video Enterprises Inc., a unit of Communications Satellite Corp. based here.
Comsat Video will pay $17 million for a 62.5% interest, with Messrs. Lee and Bynoe putting up $8 million for a 37.5% stake in the team.
Under terms of the sale, Nuggets owner Sidney Shlenker could receive up to $11 million in additional payments from the franchise's future earnings. 

Messrs. Lee and Bynoe last July announced a deal that would have made them the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise.
But the deal fell apart last week for lack of financing. 

Comsat Video is headed by Robert Wussler, who resigned his No. 2 executive post with Turner Broadcasting System Inc. just two weeks ago to take the Comsat position.
Comsat Video, which distributes pay-per-view programs to hotel rooms, plans to add Nuggets games to their offerings, as Mr. Turner did successfully with his Atlanta Hawks and Braves sports teams.
Messrs. Lee and Bynoe will manage the Nuggets' day-today affairs.
