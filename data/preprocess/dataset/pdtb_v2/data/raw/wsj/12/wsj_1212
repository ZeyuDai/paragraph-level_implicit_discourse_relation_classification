Child's Game 

There was very slow play on the market today, 

They were selling and buying by halves; 

Instead of trading like Bears and Bulls, 

They behaved like cubs and calves. 

-- George O. Ludcke. 

Politrick 

I've learned one thing from candidates, 

A technique so deftly done: 

If a question can't be answered, 

Strongly answer an unasked one! 

-- Mimi Kay. 

Foresight 

We need to get a space platform set up soon -- just in case we want to step out for a breath of fresh air. 

-- Ivern Ball.
