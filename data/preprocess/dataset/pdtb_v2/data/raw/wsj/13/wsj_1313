The Mouth is back. 

Morton Downey Jr., who self-destructed as a talk-show host and frequently verbally abused his guests, has been signed to co-host a half-hour nightly program on the Consumer News and Business Channel, the cable channel partly owned by the General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. 

The premiere of "Showdown," with Mr. Downey and Richard G. Carter, a columnist with the New York Daily News, is scheduled for Dec. 4 at 8 p.m. CNBC is available to 13 million cable households. 

Mr. Downey said he is not going to change his style, which some critics said was flamboyant and others deemed offensive. "But I'm going to proceed in a more logical way.
I'm not going to do anything that is not acceptable in anyone's home.
But that doesn't mean I'm not going to get angry." 

Michael Eskridge, president of CNBC, said that although there will be a studio audience, viewers will no longer have to endure the shouting of "Mort! Mort! Mort!" But just how does Mr. Downey's unorthodox style mesh with the sedate tone of CNBC's business programming? 

"Ninety percent of Mort's old show fits into our style," said Mr. Eskridge. "That is consumer issues." 

Mr. Downey's previous show, a one-hour shout fest, syndciated by MCA Inc. and produced by Quantum Media Inc., was canceled in July after advertisers and stations abandoned it.
