Emerson Electric Co. and Robert Bosch G.m.b.H. said the Federal Trade Commission has requested additional information from the two companies about their announced intention to acquire Vermont American Corp. for $40 a share, or about $440 million. 

Yesterday, in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Vermont American common closed at $39.75, off 25 cents. 

The FTC's request was "not unusual" and Emerson will make a "full and prompt" response, according to a spokesman.
Spokesmen for Emerson and Vermont American, which has agreed to be acquired, said they don't anticipate "any problems" with the completion of the transaction. 

An FTC spokesman said the matter is "in a non-public posture at this time" and declined to comment further. 

Emerson and Bosch, through their joint acquisition arm, Maple Acquisition, have begun a cash tender offer for all of Vermont's common shares outstanding.
The offer, set to expire Nov. 1, may be extended pending the timing and resolution of the FTC request, the companies said. 

St. Louis-based Emerson and Stuttgart-based Bosch make electrical and electronic products, including power tools.
The Vermont American acquisition is designed to enhance their position in the accessories portion of the power-tool industry.
