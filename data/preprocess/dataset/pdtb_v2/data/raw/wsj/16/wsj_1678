Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. lost its second recent arbitration case involving a former bond-trading executive. 

A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel ordered Dean Witter to pay $404,294 in back bonuses to William Kelly, the company's former head of high-yield, high-risk junk-bond trading and sales.
It also awarded $196,785 in back bonuses to former trader Michael Newcomb and $69,105 in fees to the two men's attorneys. 

The sums awarded to Messrs. Kelly and Newcomb represent bonuses the two men said they deserved from the first half of 1988, but which weren't paid because of a dispute over an incentive contract. 

Jeffrey L. Liddle, the two men's attorney at Liddle, O'Connor, Finkelstein & Robinson, said Mr. Kelly began working at Dean Witter in 1987.
Mr. Kelly built the company's high-yield bond group, which has been a minor player in the junk-bond arena. 

Dean Witter lost a separate case involving a former bond executive earlier this year; in August it paid $666,666 in back pay and a bonus to a former corporate-bond trading chief, Harold Bachman.
That award ended a dispute between Dean Witter and Mr. Bachman over who was responsible for certain bond-trading losses around the time of the 1987 stock-market crash. 

A spokesman for Dean Witter, a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., declined to comment.
