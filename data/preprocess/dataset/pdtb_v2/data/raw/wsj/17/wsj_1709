Schlumberger Ltd., New York, reported third-quarter net income edged up as growth in its oil-field services sector offset a decline in interest income. 

The lower interest income occurred because Schlumberger spent $1.2 billion buying back its stock last year. 

Net for the oil-field services and electronic measurements and systems concern rose to $114.2 million, or 48 cents a share, from $112.2 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier.
Per-share earnings advanced 14% because of the buy-back. 

Revenue declined 6.3% to $1.11 billion from $1.18 billion.
But excluding businesses acquired or sold, revenue was flat at about $1.24 billion. 

Nine-month net fell 9.5% to $323.4 million, or $1.36 a share, from $357.2 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue dropped 5.4% to $3.48 billion from $3.68 billion. 

This year's nine-month results include gains of $13 million, or five cents a share, from the sale of Schlumberger's defense systems business, and $22 million, or nine cents a share, from an award by the IranU.S.Claims Tribunal.
The year-earlier nine months include a gain of $35 million, or 13 cents a share, from sale of the company's Electricity Control & Transformers division.
