Traders trying to profit from the recent volatility in financial markets invaded the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, prompting even more swings in stock prices. 

After gaining strength during a brief run-up when trading began, the Nasdaq Composite Index weakened under selling pressure.
The forces at work included computer-guided trading, as well as profit-driven market makers and institutional investors who had bought stock on the cheap during the recent correction.
During the last two hours of trading, the composite almost drew even on the day before slipping again.
The Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.05, or 0.2%, to 459.93. 

The action was confined to Nasdaq's biggest and most liquid stocks, traders said.
The Nasdaq 100 Index began the day at 449.89, lost 2% at one point, and was up 0.4% at another.
The barometer of the biggest nonfinancial stocks settled at 448.49, off 1.40. 

Its counterpart, the Nasdaq Financial Index, was weak for most of the day, sliding 2.51 to 453.57 by the end of trading. 

The volatility was dizzying for traders. "The market must have turned up and down 15 different times," commented Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody. "Every time you thought it was going into a rally it gave up, and every time you thought it would rally it came down.
This is a tough market." 

Mr. Zipper said the market is still settling down after the recent correction.
Most of trading action now is from professional traders who are trying to take advantage of the price swings to turn a quick profit, he and other traders said. "Everybody's confused and no one has an opinion that lasts longer than 30 seconds," said Mr. Zipper. "A lot of the professional traders are just going back and forth.
They're just as confused." 

William Rothe, head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown & Sons, in Baltimore, said program trading is keeping the markets unsettled.
He believes that the volatile conditions created by program trading has "thoroughly confused" investors about where the market is headed.
Program trading is "benefiting a few to the detriment of many and I wish someone would do something about it," he complained. 

Trading activity cooled off from Monday's sizzling pace.
Share turnover subsided to 161.5 million.
Advancing and declining issues finished about even.
Of the 4,345 stocks that changed hands, 1,174 declined and 1,040 advanced. 

One big technology issue, Novell, rode the roller coaster.
The stock, which finished Monday at 29 1/2, traded as high as 29 3/4 and as low as 28 3/4 before closing at 29 1/4, down 1/4. 

It was a jarring day for investors in Genetics Institute.
The stock tumbled 2 3/4 on news that it might have to take a charge against earnings if it can't successfully resolve a dispute with its European licensee, Boehringer Mannheim, over its anti-anemia drug, EPO.
The stock recovered somewhat to finish 1 1/4 lower at 26 1/4. 

In a statement, Genetics Institute said the dispute with Boehringer centers on questions of the usability of certain batches of EPO material valued at $13.6 million.
Earlier this week, Genetics Institute reported wider losses in its fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31. 

Price Co. jumped 2 1/4 to 44 on 1.7 million shares.
The wholesaler of cash and carry merchandise reported fiscal fourthquarter earnings that were better than analysts had expected.
The company also pleased analysts by announcing four new store openings planned for fiscal 1990, ending next August.
That will bring the total for the year to 10, from five during fiscal 1989. 

"Every year we've been waiting for stepped-up expansion from the company.
The news couldn't have been better," said Linda Kristiansen, a Dean Witter Reynolds analyst, in an interview. 

Intermec, a maker of optical character-recognition devices, also reported higher third-quarter earnings.
Its shares added 3/4 to 30 3/4. 

But favorable earnings wasn't a guarantee that a stock's price would improve yesterday.
MCI Communications tumbled 2 5/8 to 42 3/8 on 4.7 million shares even though the telecommunications giant reported a 63% increase in third-quarter profit. 

CoreStates Financial slipped 3/8 to 43 1/8 in active trading after reporting that third-quarter earnings improved to $1.27 a share from $1.15 a share a year earlier.
However, the bank holding company's loan-loss reserves rose to $177.3 million from $154 million a year earlier. 

A&W Brands lost 1/4 to 27.
But its thirdquarter earnings rose to 26 cents a share from 18 cents a share last year. 

Capital Associates dropped 1 to 5 3/8.
The company, which leases technology equipment, reported substantially lower net income for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Aug. 31.
