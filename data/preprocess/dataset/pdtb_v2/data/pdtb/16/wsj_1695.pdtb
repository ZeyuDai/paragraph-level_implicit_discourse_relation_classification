First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do.
To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns. 

Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.
This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House

An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 (when control of that body changed party hands) reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table cannot be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise, due to their majority-party status, over other resources such as committee staff
